# Moving-through-Space-Adventure-Game
This program implements a “Moving through Space” Adventure Game.

My program is a game about a knight whose goal is to rescue a princess. The princess is trapped in a big castle which has ten rooms, and each room has a monster. So the player control the knight to fight against the monster at each room. After player defeats a monster in one room, knight can choose a reward and add it to backpack, then choose a next room to go. A reward is a weapon or a potion, which is an item knight can use in the next fight to increase the probability of win. Knight will successfully rescue the princess and win the game after defeating all the ten monsters in each rooms.

## How to run the game
Just run the `Game.py` by `python .\Game.py`.

Then you can play the game in console, like `cmd` or `PowerShell`.
